However, due to inadequate research infrastructures, limited resources, and a lack of local support, amongst various other difficulties, researchers in developing countries are facing significant hurdles in moving Open Science forward. The Chinese Open Science Network (COSN) was initiated to make the voice of Open Science heard by Chinese-speaking early-career researchers (ECRs) and to bridge the Chinese-speaking community with the broader open science communities. COSN has organized in-person workshops, online journal club sessions, talks, and tutorials, and has translated English articles/blogs into Chinese. Now, the COSN official WeChat account has over 32,000 subscribers, and more than 1,000 researchers/students actively participate in discussions on Open Science. In this talk, I will share COSN’s experiences and insights in developing such a grassroots network and provide tips for ECRs in developing countries who would like to start their Open Science initiatives.","30 min presentation, 30 min questions","Everyone","#conf2024-plenary1-chuan-peng-hu","https://app.slack.com/client/T01R8PN145B/C07KECFUY79",NA

We will introduce and familiarize participants with the ShareTrait platform, which has been developed to make trait data interoperable and reusable.","The workshop will start with an overview of best practices for trait data collection and reporting based on the FAIR data principles, highlighting how ShareTrait is able to overcome existing barriers. This is a BYOD workshop, i.e. Bring Your Own Data.  Beforehand, the participants will already have received information about ShareTrait, the traits of interest and the process to submit data, so that the participants are prepared and have brought all the necessary (meta)data for submission. Participants will be guided through the data submission process. As part of the workshop, we will have scheduled intermezzos to discuss questions and ideas about further facilitating FAIR data with all participants. We conclude the workshop with a summary of the lessons learned and insights gained about data extraction and best practices for data usage.","We welcome researchers of any level, as long as they have at least one trait dataset of their own that deals with metabolism, fecundity or development in ectotherms. We ask participants to bring their dataset, including the necessary metadata. Previous experience with databases or open data is not necessary as during the workshop we offer the possibility to acquaint themselves with these topics.","#conf2024-w04-making-trait-data-interoperable-and-reusable","https://app.slack.com/client/T01R8PN145B/C07L7PEK8QH",NA
