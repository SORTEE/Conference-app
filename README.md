This code generates a web app for visualising the program of SORTEE conferences.
It was developed by SORTEE members and updated by Adrian Barnett.  
Feel free to use this code for your conference, and don't hesitate to contact us if you need help. You can credit us with something like "Thanks to SORTEE for developing and sharing this app https://www.sortee.org/"

The folder name where the files are stored is important because the link to your web app will be:
